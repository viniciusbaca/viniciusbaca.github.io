Hey! I'm a software engineer currently working on counterabuse at Google in the São Paulo office. Previously I was a 
quantitative developer at Legacy Capital, a Brazilian hedge fund. 

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems from the [University of Sao Paulo](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/).

My technical background at Legacy was rooted in quantitative analysis, specifically optimizing backtesting engines 
and algorithms.
At Google, my scope has expanded to large-scale C++ infrastructure for counterabuse across many products. I really 
enjoy working on both sides of that spectrum, both massive systems and data processing.
